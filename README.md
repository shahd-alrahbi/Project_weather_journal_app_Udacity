# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather based on user's location, and dynamically update UI.

## Instructions
* In the server.js file, ensure your development environment is set up correctly, with Node and the necessary packages installed. Verify the inclusion of express, cors, and body-parser, as these are essential for a smooth server operation. Review and strengthen the POST and GET routes, incorporating error-handling mechanisms for data retrieval and storage robustness.

* Within website/app.js, focus on the asynchronous functions responsible for fetching weather data and dynamically updating the UI. Confirm the integration of API credentials from OpenWeatherMap. Validate that the UI-updating function is working as expected, checking the console for any potential errors.

* The application will show.
  - the temperature.
  - the date.
  - your feelings.
